# 💻 CAE Fundamentals

## 🏁 Objective
Develop a structural analysis solver based on the Finite Element Method (FEM) capable of processing input data from native files generated by commercial software, such as Patran.

## 📙 Inspiration
This project was inspired by the ambition to implement the numerical formulation of structural analysis from the ground up, drawing on foundational principles of the Finite Element Method and guided by the reference book _"Elementos Finitos – A base da tecnologia CAE by Alves Filho, A. (2018), Saraiva Educação S.A."_

## 🔧 Implementation
This **Python-based** project implements a structural analysis solver using the Finite Element Method with an object-oriented approach. Each element type is represented as a class, promoting modularity and algorithm reuse. The solver parses `.bdf` files for pre-processing and exports results in `.csv` format for efficient post-processing and visualization.
